 abstract = {Herein we report the intramolecular arene C--H and C--F bond oxygenation by tetranuclear iron complexes. Treatment of $[$LFe3(PhPz)3OFe$]$$[$OTf$]$2 (1) or its fluorinated analog $[$LFe3(F2ArPz)3OFe$]$$[$OTf$]$2 (5) with iodosobenzene results in the regioselective hydroxylation of a bridging pyrazolate ligand, converting a C--H or C--F bond into a C--O bond. The observed reactivity suggests the formation of terminal and reactive Fe-oxo intermediates. With the possibility of intramolecular electron transfer within clusters in 1 and 5, different reaction pathways (FeIV-oxo vs FeIII-oxo) might be responsible for the observed arene hydroxylation.},
