abstract: "Although alkyl complexes of [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>] clusters have been invoked as intermediates in a number of enzymatic reactions, obtaining a detailed understanding of their reactivity patterns and electronic structures has been difficult owing to their transient nature. To address this challenge, we herein report the synthesis and characterization of a 3:1 site-differentiated [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>-alkyl cluster. Whereas [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> clusters typically exhibit pairwise delocalized electronic structures in which each Fe has a formal valence of 2.5+, MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopic and computational studies suggest that the highly electron-releasing alkyl group partially localizes the charge distribution within the cubane, an effect that has not been previously observed in tetrahedrally coordinated [Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>] clusters."
