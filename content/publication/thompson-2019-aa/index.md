abstract: "The intermediacy of metal--NNH<sub>2</sub> complexes has been implicated in the catalytic cycles of several examples of transition-metal-mediated nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) fixation. In this context, we have shown that triphosphine-supported Fe(N<sub>2</sub>) complexes can be reduced and protonated at the distal N atom to yield Fe(NNH<sub>2</sub>) complexes over an array of charge and oxidation states. Upon exposure to further H<sup>+</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> equivalents, these species either continue down a distal-type Chatt pathway to yield a terminal iron(IV) nitride or instead follow a distal-to-alternating pathway resulting in N--H bond formation at the proximal N atom. To understand the origin of this divergent selectivity, herein we synthesize and elucidate the electronic structures of a redox series of Fe(NNMe<sub>2</sub>) complexes, which serve as spectroscopic models for their reactive protonated congeners. Using a combination of spectroscopies, in concert with density functional theory and correlated ab initio calculations, we evidence one-electron redox noninnocence of the ``NNMe2''moiety. Specifically, although two closed-shell configurations of the &ldquo;
NNR<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; ligand have been commonly considered in the literature---isodiazene and hydrazido(2âˆ’)---we provide evidence suggesting that, in their reduced forms, the present iron complexes are best viewed in terms of an open-shell [NNR<sub>2</sub>]<sup>&#183;-</sup> ligand coupled antiferromagnetically to the Fe center. This one-electron redox noninnocence resembles that of the classically noninnocent ligand NO and may have mechanistic implications for selectivity in N<sub>2</sub> fixation activity."
