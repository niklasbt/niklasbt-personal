abstract: "Abstract Species with 2-center, 3-electron (2c/3e−) σ bonds are of interest owing to their fascinating electronic structures and potential for interesting reactivity patterns. Report here is the synthesis and characterization of a pair of zerovalent (d<sup>9</sup>) trigonal pyramidal Rh and Ir complexes that feature 2c/3e− σ bonds to the Si atom of a tripodal tris(phosphine)silatrane ligand. X-ray diffraction, continuous wave and pulse electron paramagnetic resonance, density-functional theory calculations, and reactivity studies have been used to characterize these electronically distinctive compounds. The data available highlight a 2c/3e− bonding framework with a σ<sup>&#42;</sup>-SOMO of metal 4- or 5d<sub>z</sub><sup>2</sup> parentage that is partially stabilized by significant mixing with Si (3p<sub>z</sub>) and metal (5- or 6p<sub>z</sub>) orbitals. Metal-ligand covalency thus buffers the expected destabilization of transition-metal (TM)-silyl σ<sup>&#42;</sup>-orbitals by d--p mixing, affording well-characterized examples of TM--main group, and hence polar, 2c/3e− σ &ldquo;half-bonds&rdquo;."
