abstract: "Well-defined molecular catalysts for the reduction of N<sub>2</sub> to NH<sub>3</sub> with protons and electrons remain very rare despite decades of interest and are currently limited to systems featuring molybdenum or iron. This report details the synthesis of a molecular cobalt complex that generates superstoichiometric yields of NH<sub>3</sub> (>200% NH<sub>3</sub> per Co--N<sub>2</sub> precursor) via the direct reduction of N<sub>2</sub> with protons and electrons. While the NH<sub>3</sub> yields reported herein are modest by comparison to those of previously described iron and molybdenum systems, they intimate that other metals are likely to be viable as molecular N<sub>2</sub> reduction catalysts. Additionally, a comparison of the featured tris(phosphine)borane Co--N<sub>2</sub> complex with structurally related Co--N<sub>2</sub> and Fe--N<sub>2</sub> species shows how remarkably sensitive the N<sub>2</sub> reduction performance of potential precatalysts is. These studies enable consideration of the structural and electronic effects that are likely relevant to N<sub>2</sub> conversion activity, including the πbasicity, charge state, and geometric flexibility."
