abstract: "Abstract We report the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of [LFe<sub>3</sub>(PhPz)<sub>3</sub>OMn(<sup>s</sup>PhIO)][OTf]<sub>x</sub> (<b>3</b>: x=2; <b>4</b>: x=3), where <b>4</b> is one of very few examples of iodosobenzene--metal adducts characterized by X-ray crystallography. Access to these rare heterometallic clusters enabled differentiation of the metal centers involved in oxygen atom transfer (Mn) or redox modulation (Fe). Specifically, <sup>57</sup>Fe Mössbauer and X-ray absorption spectroscopy provided unique insights into how changes in oxidation state (Fe<sup>III</sup><sub>2</sub>Fe<sup>II</sup>Mn<sup>II</sup> vs. Fe<sup>III</sup><sub>3</sub>Mn<sup>II</sup>) influence oxygen atom transfer in tetranuclear Fe<sub>3</sub>Mn clusters. In particular, a one-electron redox change at a distal metal site leads to a change in oxygen atom transfer reactivity by ca. two orders of magnitude."
