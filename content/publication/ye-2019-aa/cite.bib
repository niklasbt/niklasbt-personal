 abstract = {Although alkyl complexes of $[$Fe4S4$]$ clusters have been invoked as intermediates in a number of enzymatic reactions, obtaining a detailed understanding of their reactivity patterns and electronic structures has been difficult owing to their transient nature. To address this challenge, we herein report the synthesis and characterization of a 3:1 site-differentiated $[$Fe4S4$]$2+--alkyl cluster. Whereas $[$Fe4S4$]$2+ clusters typically exhibit pairwise delocalized electronic structures in which each Fe has a formal valence of 2.5+, Mössbauer spectroscopic and computational studies suggest that the highly electron-releasing alkyl group partially localizes the charge distribution within the cubane, an effect that has not been previously observed in tetrahedrally coordinated $[$Fe4S4$]$ clusters.},
