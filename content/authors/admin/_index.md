Niklas Thompson is currently a NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Postdoctoral Fellow appointed at the Massachusetts Institute of Techology under the mentorship of Prof. Daniel L. M. Suess. His current research interests center on elucidating how the physiochemical propterties of biological metallocofactors evolve from their underlying electronic structures. Recently, he has focused on developing and deepening our understanding of Nature's most ubiquitous class of metallocofactors---the iron--sulfur clusters. In addition to their biological importance, these clusters have, and continue, to serve as prototypical small-molecule models to study the magnetic phenomena---e.g., exchange coupling, spin-dependent valence delocalization---that provide the fundamental bridge between cluster chemistry and condensed matter physics.
