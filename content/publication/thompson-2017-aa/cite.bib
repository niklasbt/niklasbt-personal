 abstract = {Terminal iron nitrides (Fe≡N) have been proposed as intermediates of (bio)catalytic nitrogen fixation, yet experimental evidence to support this hypothesis has been lacking. In particular, no prior synthetic examples of terminal Fe≡N species have been derived from N2. Here we show that a nitrogen-fixing Fe--N2 catalyst can be protonated to form a neutral Fe(NNH2) hydrazido(2−) intermediate, which, upon further protonation, heterolytically cleaves the N--N bond to release $[$FeIV≡N$]$+ and NH3. These observations provide direct evidence for the viability of a Chatt-type (distal) mechanism for Fe-mediated N2-to-NH3 conversion. The physical oxidation state range of the Fe complexes in this transformation is buffered by covalency with the ligand, a feature of possible relevance to catalyst design in synthetic and natural systems that facilitate multiproton/multielectron redox processes.},
