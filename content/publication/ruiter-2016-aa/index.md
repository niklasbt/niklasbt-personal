abstract: "Herein we report the intramolecular arene C--H and C--F bond oxygenation by tetranuclear iron complexes. Treatment of [LFe<sub>3</sub>(PhPz)<sub>3</sub>OFe][OTf]<sub>2</sub> (1) or its fluorinated analog [LFe<sub>3</sub>(F<sub>2</sub>ArPz)<sub>3</sub>OFe][OTf]<sub>2</sub> (5) with iodosobenzene results in the regioselective hydroxylation of a bridging pyrazolate ligand, converting a C--H or C--F bond into a C--O bond. The observed reactivity suggests the formation of terminal and reactive Fe-oxo intermediates. With the possibility of intramolecular electron transfer within clusters in <b>1</b> and <b>5</b>, different reaction pathways (Fe<sup>IV</sup>-oxo vs Fe<sup>III</sup>-oxo) might be responsible for the observed arene hydroxylation."
